    provider and has been developing skilled professionals since 1987. We offer
    training solutions for full time and part time students. Our national
    qualifications and international vendor-related certifications are updated
    regularly according to industry standards and pave the road to success for
    our graduates entering future jobs introduced by the 4th Industrial
    Revolution. We also offer short courses that are skills-based and
    vendor-specific. International certifications are available to specific
    relevant qualifications. CTU Training Solutions is a Level 2 B-BBEE
    contributor and can assist companies with learnerships. CTU is also
    registered with the Department of Higher Education as a Private Higher
    Education Institution. We have over 14 registered ICT learnerships up to NQF
    Level 6. Skills shortages are a key threat to the future growth of South
    African businesses. Upskilling the existing workforce is vital for securing
    a business' future and ensuring it remains competitive. If you or your
    employees are well trained, they'll be more productive, leading to increased
    efficiency, and higher profits for your business. With faculties in IT,
    Design, Business & Management, Engineering and Humanities, participants have
    the choice to study full time (1 to 3-year qualifications and technical and
    other diplomas) or part time (qualifications, short courses and skills
    development programmes).
