      CTU Training Solutions is an award-winning private tertiary education
      provider and has been developing skilled professionals since 1987. We
      offer training solutions for full time and part time students. Our
      national qualifications and international vendor-related certifications
      are updated regularly according to industry standards and pave the road to
      success for our graduates entering future jobs introduced by the 4th
      Industrial Revolution. We also offer short courses that are skills-based
      and vendor-specific. International certifications are available to
      specific relevant qualifications. CTU Training Solutions is a Level 2
      B-BBEE contributor and can assist companies with learnerships. CTU is also
      registered with the Department of Higher Education as a Private Higher
      Education Institution. We have over 14 registered ICT learnerships up to
      NQF Level 6. Skills shortages are a key threat to the future growth of
      South African businesses. Upskilling the existing workforce is vital for
      securing a business' future and ensuring it remains competitive. If you or
      your employees are well trained, they'll be more productive, leading to
      increased efficiency, and higher profits for your business. With faculties
      in IT, Design, Business & Management, Engineering and Humanities,
      participants have the choice to study full time (1 to 3-year
      qualifications and technical and other diplomas) or part time
      (qualifications, short courses and skills development programmes).
